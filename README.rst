Django web framework solves only technical problems related to the
client-server interaction on top of the stateless HTTP
protocol. Model-View-Template separation pattern helps to maintain
simple CRUD based logic. Viewflow is the library that offers an
additional layer of django web framework, allows explicitly specify
people's workflow and extracts collaboration logic from django views.

Viewflow layer is based on the BPMN - business process management and
notation standard. It is the graphical notation readily understandable
by all business stakeholders and software developers. Viewflow bridges
the gap between a picture as the software specification and the
working solution.

Django-Material frontend is the lightweight alternative to the django
admin and allows you to build business applications. It's based on
Google Material Design, that could be easily customized to your brand
colors. Django-Material takes care of site-wide navigation, complex
form construction, datagrids and CRUD functionality. Ready for fast
development of any CRM, ERP, Business Management Software.
