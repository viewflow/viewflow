# Security Policy

## Scope

Viewflow is a thin workflow layer on top of standard Django web framework and includes several 3d-party Js libraries.

You must only test for vulnerabilities against the following targets:
* Vunerable dependencies included into the result Viewflow build
* Viewflow itself

## Supported Versions

Only the latest open source version receives updates and security patches

For PRO clients, security updates are provided for any supported version (see README) if possible, without upgrading the major dependencies

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any GitHub-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

Instead, please send an email to mikhail@viewflow.io

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better understand and resolve the issue:

The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)

Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
